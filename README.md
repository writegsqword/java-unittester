# java-unittester  

## how use(reflection): 

paste this into your main class or something  
call TestMethod and pass in your args  
probably only works with simple types, i dont care enough to cover all cases  

## how use(macro): 


put macro-sed.sh and test.sh into the same folder  
run `bash test.sh <source file here>`
